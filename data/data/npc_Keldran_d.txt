^5Welcome to my humble weapons and armor shop!

I'd have a bigger selection; however, since bandit
raids have been increasing all over, shipments have
been steadily slowing down, and in retaliation, the
locals have bought out all of my higher-quality
stock. The prices are still more than fair.

I refuse to change them even in bad times.
